# Mission_to_mars
Robin, who loves astronomy and wants to work for NASA one day, has decided to use a specific method of gathering the latest data: web scraping. Using this technique, she has the ability to pull data from multiple websites, store it in a database, then present the collected data in a central location: a webpage. We are helping Robin to write a Python script using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate web browsers and extract data; then store the data using MongoDB; build and app using Flask; and last, creating a portafolio using Boostrap (a HTML on CSS framework).

What we need to do:

We need to explore the design of the webpage so that we can write a script that knows what it's looking at when it interacts with a webpage. Robin wants to be kept up to date with different Mars news, and she's enjoyed the articles published on the NASA news website Mars https://mars.nasa.gov/news/?page=0&per_page=40&order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&search=&category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&blank_scope=Latest
